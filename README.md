__Updated for TensorFlow 2__, the old version is on the [1_x](https://github.com/suyash/transformer/tree/1_x) branch.

This is implemented in the most frictionless approach I have found so far for training keras models that save to `SavedModel`s that can be used elsewhere. See 1_x branch for other approaches.

Demos for [classification](/text_classification_demo.ipynb) and [translation](/machine_translation_demo.ipynb) from trained `SavedModel`s are available.
